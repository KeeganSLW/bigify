# Bigify Your Text

A silly simple tool for displaying things like web URLs for an audience to easily see very **BIG**.

Whatever is typed or pasted in the form field at the very bottom of the screen is bigified. This uses [FitText](http://fittextjs.com/) for scaling with window size. It probably could be done with [viewport sized typography](https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/).

I just did this as something to do on a cross country flight. And I need it for an upcoming workshop. Many ways this could be improved. That falls on you to fork it, eh?
