# Bigify Your Text

A silly simple tool for displaying things like web URLs for an audience to easily see very **BIG**.

Use it yourself at https://cogdog.github.io/bigify

Whatever is typed or pasted in the form field at the very bottom of the screen is bigified. This uses [FitText](http://fittextjs.com/) for scaling with window size. It probably could be done with [viewport sized typography](https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/).

I just did this as something to do on a cross country flight. And I need it for an upcoming workshop. Many ways this could be improved. That falls on you to fork it, eh?



## Updates

* Oct 02, 2016 Added capability to pre-load content via query string; the current content is saved as a link via small icon in bottom right. Just copy the URL to use as a preloaded Bigif- try  https://cogdog.github.io/bigify?t=Now+you+can+preset+what+is+bigified!

* Aug 13, 2017 Thanks [John Johnston](https://github.com/troutcolor) for introducing better way to show/hide the form field.
